## General Code of Conduct

* Always communicate. Always be online on Slack.
* Always work with a Pull Request. Long running PRs are welcome but mark them with [WIP] so we don't merge it.
* Follow the git flow principles.
* We always work with a Milestone. See the current milestone here https://github.com/organization/project/issues/milestones link changed purposely
* Don't hesitate to review other people's work. Always welcome criticism.
* Always get your PR code reviewed by somebody else. Please do not self-merge unless seriously needed (like a critical bug that needs to be deployed ASAP).
* Always keep your PR up to date. Rebase frequently.
* We love screenshots of work, share us what you are working on. It helps the code reviewer understand your work better.
* Be consistent with other people's way of doing things but feel free to discuss improvements.
* Always be testing. We don't require 100% test coverage but we do take testing really seriously.
* If you can't immediately write a test for a method, make sure to still write a test case and just put pending 'explain the reason why' so you or somebody else can return to it later.
* We don't need our code to have a lot of comments. Good code is like a good joke, it doesn't need an explanation. Make your code readable instead.
* We put more weight in code clarity.
* We love metaprogramming but stop metaprogramming just for the sake of doing it without any added value. Again, code clarity.
* Make use of special ANNOTATIONS like # TODO:, FIXME:, OPTIMIZE: so rake notes can pick it up.
* Found a bug? Do not wait. File immediately on github issues! We get notified instantly anyway.
* When in doubt, ask on Slack.
* Prevent being a blocker to your teammates.
* Bonus points for being proactive.
* Finally, be a good teammate.

## Tools

Slack - I can't emphasize more how Slack improved our development workflow and our ability to maintain such a good system of communication and integration among our 3rd party and in-house tools. It's also a great way to share screenshots, code snippets, files and funny gifs. Custom emoticons are awesome :) - All github, jenkins, error notifications constantly streams to different Slack channels keeping us on top of what's happening.

Github Milestones & Issues are so effective in organizing our current backlog. We're now using Github all the way and we're keeping track of features via a PR. We still do use Pivotal Tracker on other projects though but we may have to discard them in the future though.

Asana for general task management.

New Relic for error notifications.
